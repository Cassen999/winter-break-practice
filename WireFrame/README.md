This image should be able to be zoomed after it's downloaded and be readable
If it isn't then just let me know and I will see if the website I made it on offers
another option, the only other way I saw to show people was to add them to a 
workspace on the website
I could also zoom in and do multiple screenshots but I thought that might
look confusing
