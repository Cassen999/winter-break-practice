We need a function that can transform a number into a string.
What ways of achieving this do you know?

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers 
and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Create a function that converts US dollars (USD) to Chinese Yuan (CNY) . The input is the amount of USD as an integer, and the output should be a string that states the amount of Yuan followed by 'Chinese Yuan'
For Example:
  usdcny(15) // => '101.25 Chinese Yuan'
  usdcny(465) // => '3138.75 Chinese Yuan'
The conversion rate you should use is 6.75 CNY for every 1 USD. All numbers shold be rounded to the nearest hundredth (e.g. 21.00 NOT 21.0 or 21)

Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.
As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(
So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:
[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.
Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)
